You will need to install MATLAB or [GNU Octave][gnu-octave] to do this lesson.

You will also need to download some data, which we will analyze using MATLAB:

1. Make a new folder on your Desktop called *matlab-novice-inflammation*.
2. Download [matlab-novice-inflammation.zip]({{ page.root}}/data/matlab-novice-inflammation.zip) and move the file to this folder.
3. Extract the zip archive. This will place all the data in the `matlab-novice-inflammation` directory.
   Note that on Windows, double-clicking on the zip file simply previews the contents: to extract, right-click and select **Extract All**
4. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:

	~~~
	cd Desktop/matlab-novice-inflammation/data
	~~~
	{: .bash}
