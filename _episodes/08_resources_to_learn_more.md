## At OSU:

### Classes

**CHE 581: Introduction to Numerical Methods Using MATLAB**.  The course is designed for graduate students (although well-prepared undergraduate students can take it tooâ€¦) with minimal previous experience with programming or MATLAB.  The course focuses on (1) Learning how to develop basic programming skills (using MATLAB) such as looping and decision statements, and (2) development of a suite of numerical methods and techniques that can be helpful in research.  Specific topics include:
- Programming in MATLAB
- Plotting
- Numerical differentiation
- Numerical integration
- Numerical solutions to ODEs
- Finite-difference approximations for PDEs

The course is open to students across campus who are of gradate standing (or with permission).  Familiarity with basic calculus, ordinary differential equations,  and linear algebra will be expected. 

### Tutorials

The Department of Mathematics at OSU has three tutorials that focus on number formatting and arrays, on matrices, plots, and models, and on MATLAB specific syntax (sin, cos, rand, pi, etc.). They can be accessed through the page [https://math.oregonstate.edu/mlc_matlabtutorial](https://math.oregonstate.edu/mlc_matlabtutorial)

## Resources by Mathworks

The MATLAB help is very complete. Type `help functionname` if you want to learn about how to use a particular function named functionname, or search in the [MATLAB documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/).
